## ARG-baed imputation and regional frequency

This repository provides tools and scripts to perform ARG-based imputation and regional frequency estimation with genealogical record. It is built upon the work available in three differente repositories

## Analysis

1. To generate the ARG files from genotype array data, use this following repository: https://github.com/almejiaga/ARG_needle

2. To perform ARG-imputation from an ARG in tskit format and a vcf file, please use: https://github.com/almejiaga/ARG-imputation

3. To infer carrier frequencies from a set of carriers using ISGen, refer to this fork repository: https://github.com/almejiaga/ISGen
