# IBD Segment Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides tools and scripts for analyzing Identity-By-Descent (IBD) segments. It is built upon the work available in the [`IBD-segment`](https://github.com/JustinPelletier/IBD-segment) repository.



# Downstream analyses

1. Louvain Clustering algorythim (3 iterations): IGraph_clustering.R
2. FST calculation between clusters and clumping: FST_plink.sh and FST_merge_clusters.R
3. Figures generated per cluster: final_new_Cluster_and_PCA.R
4. Figure generated for within cluster IBD sharing: within_cluster_IBD.R
5. Figure generated between cluster IBD sharing: between_cluster_IBD_louvain3.R
