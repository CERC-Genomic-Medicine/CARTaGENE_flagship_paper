# CARTaGENE flagship paper

This repository contains the source code used to process data and generate tables and figures in the flagship paper for the CARTaGENE study in Quebec, Canada.

## Directory contents

* `ARG-based imputation and regional frequency` - contains source code used to identify likely carriers in genotyping array data in the *"Variants of clinical interest (VCI): using CaG to go beyond founder variants"* section of the manuscript.
* `GWAS` - contains source code used for genome-wide association scans, fine-mapping, and generating tables and figures in the *"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)"* section of the manuscript.
* `Genotype_processing` - contains source code used for the genotyping array data pre-processing before genotype imputation and GWASs.
* `HLA` - contains source code used for the HLA data generation, analysis and generating tables and figures in the *"Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genotyping"* section of the manuscript.
* `IBD` - contains source code used for the identity-by-descent (IBD) analyses and generating tables and figures in the *"Genetic structure in CaG"* section of the manuscript.
* `Imputation` - contains source code used for preparing and benchmarking the genotype imputation reference panel in the *"Haplotype reference panel and genotype imputation "* section of the manuscript.
* `pca_umap_clustering` - contains source code used for the Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in the *"Genetic structure in CaG"* section of the manuscript.
* `phasing` - contains source code used for statistical phasing and benchmarking phasing quality in the *"Haplotype reference panel and genotype imputation"* section of the manuscript.
