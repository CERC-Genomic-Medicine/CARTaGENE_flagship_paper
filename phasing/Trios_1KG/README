This is 1000G + HGDP data phased using trio information as part of the GnomAD v3 project.
The data is published in https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.23.525248

Steps to prepare samples for benchmarking:

1) Extract all independent trios based on these conditions: (1) sample has mother and father present in the dataset; (2) sample was marked as "related" by GnomAD; (3) both mother and father are not marked as "related" by GnomAD; (4) both mother and father don't have any other children in the dataset; (5) both mother and father don't have their parents (i.e. grandparents) in the dataset; (6) both parents have matching assigned genetic ancestry label.

python extract_trios.py > trios.txt

2) Pick random trios from 'trios.txt' file, e.g.:

grep "^AFR" trios.txt | grep -vw 0 | shuf | head -n10 | cut -f2,3,4 -d" " > AFR_random10.ped
...
grep "^EUR" trios.txt | grep -vw 0 | shuf | head -n10 | cut -f2,3,4 -d" " > EUR_random10.ped

3) Subset and phase offsprings in randomly picked trios using tool from https://github.com/odelaneau/makeScaffold.
